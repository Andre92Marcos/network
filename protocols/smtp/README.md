# smtp - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

## Overview

The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol utilized within the TCP/IP suite for the sending and receiving of e-mail. Due to its limitations in queuing messages at the recipient's end, SMTP is often employed alongside either POP3 or IMAP. These additional protocols enable users to store messages on a server mailbox and to periodically download them.

In practice, it is common for e-mail programs to employ SMTP for sending e-mails, while utilizing POP3 or IMAP for receiving them.
